# Frontend for the xOCAL Project

This is the frontend for the xOCAL Project. It is written in React.JS, and uses the MUI UI components, along with Mapbox GL JS for the GIS systems. It is divided into:

    - *App.js*: Contains the Map component, along with containers for the Sidebar. This file is the "top level" file for the entire frontend, and contains the callbacks from the sidebar "control panel" of the app, which then affect the Map component by removing, reordering or adding layers, or modifying the properties thereof.
    - *Sidebar.js*: The sidebar menu controlled by the Hamburger menu, along with the app bar for the project. This contains the configuration for `react-beautiful-dnd`, a framework that is used here in order to facilitate dragging and dropping in order to reorder the layers. It also contains the UI elements in the forms of checkboxes and sliders, which call a function passed to them in the props of the `Sidebar` component that is used within the top-level `App.js` component.
    - components/ : This directory contains "small" components, usually one div. The "DraggableItem", which is a wrapper for each layer within the "Droppable" area, mainly uses components defined here, including
        - Checkbox
        - Checkbox with sliders 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
